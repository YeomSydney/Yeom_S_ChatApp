# Chat App Assignment

## Description
Use Node, Express and Vue with socket.io to create a live interactive chat application. We will
continue exploring components, APIs etc with a brief intro to Node and NPM.

We’ll be building most of this in class as an intro to Node. The back end / API will be pretty
lightweight, which gives you lots of time to think about other features to include as a more
complete application.

Expand on the default functionality / class build. You could add (or finish) the login page / user
registration, include a notification message when a user leaves the chat, or add the ability to
add a custom avatar per user.
Choose at least one other enhancement - NOT including what’s already in the class build - to
implement.
